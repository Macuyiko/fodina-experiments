fodina-experiments
==================

Experimental setup code for performing the experiments in the paper "Fodina: a Robust and Flexible Heuristic Process Discovery Technique". See: http://www.processmining.be/fodina.

This code has been uploaded here mainly for research integrity reasons (allowing peers to validate our work). However, many parts should prove useful for those willing to perform experiments with ProM 6 or ProM 5 miners.

I would appreciate a heads up at seppe.vandenbroucke@kuleuven.be if you were able to (re)use any parts.
